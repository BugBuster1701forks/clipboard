Clipboard
======================

About
-----

The clipboard extension offers the possibility to store various content (pages, articles and content-elements) to the clipboard for a extended time-period. All stored entries can easily be transfered from one to another installation of Contao through the backend file manager or the use of FTP. 

The saved XML-Data gets collected in a new folder within the Contao file structure: ~/tl_files/clipboard/...
